# wwimin.com
This is the source code repository for a website I'm volunteering my time to build, because it is a cause I am passionate about - [wwimin.com](http://wwimin.com).

## Development Guide
```
git clone git@github.com:wwimin/wwimin.git
cd wwimin/
npm install
chmod +x build.js && node build.js
```
Note: You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to do these things.
The build script is technically optional, since it just minifies things.

Afterwards, you can upload the whole directory to a static web host of your
choice.
